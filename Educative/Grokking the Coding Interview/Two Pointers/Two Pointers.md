1. As the name suggests, it involves maintaining two pointers that traverse the data structure in a coordinated manner, typically starting from different positions or moving in opposite directions.

2. Whenever there’s a requirement to find two data elements in an array that satisfy a certain condition, the two pointers pattern should be the first strategy to come to mind.

## Does your problem match this pattern?

Yes, if all of these conditions are fulfilled:
- **Linear data structure:** The input data can be traversed in a linear fashion, such as an array, linked list, or string.
    
- **Process pairs:** Process data elements at two different positions simultaneously.
    
- **Dynamic pointer movement:** Both pointers move independently of each other according to certain conditions or criteria. In addition, both pointers might move along the same or two different data structures
